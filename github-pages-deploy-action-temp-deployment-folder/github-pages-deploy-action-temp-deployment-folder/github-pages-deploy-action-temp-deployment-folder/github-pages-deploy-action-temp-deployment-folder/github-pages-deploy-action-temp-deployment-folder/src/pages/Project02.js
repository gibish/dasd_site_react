                In agriculture, ecological monitoring and medicine it is very important to obtain data of the real-time
                influence of stress factors of natural or anthropogenic origin on the state of biological objects (e.g.
                plants, humans etc.). For this purposes special means are used in modern industrial agriculture,
                environmental monitoring, medicine and military applications. The applications of modern achievements in
                microelectronics, biosensors, and communications and information technologies make it possible to solve
                this rather complicated problem of real-time monitoring of state of lots of biological objects. The most
                perspective technology for realization of data acquisition and processing systems is wireless sensor
                network.
